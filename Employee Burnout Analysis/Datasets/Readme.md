Employee burnout is a syndrome that results from chronic stress at work, with several consequences to workers' well-being and health⁴. It's characterized by symptoms such as exhaustion, disengagement, absenteeism, lack of motivation and productivity, irritability, job dissatisfaction, and lack of feelings of achievement².

Here are some key points about employee burnout:

1. **Causes**: Employees frequently cite the feeling of always being on call, unfair treatment, unreasonable workload, low autonomy, and lack of social support as aspects of their jobs that undermine their mental health and well-being¹.
2. **Consequences**: Burnout can lead to costly organizational issues such as attrition, absenteeism, lower engagement, and decreased productivity¹. It's also a serious mental health problem that can affect many people's lives².
3. **Analysis and Measurement**: The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is often used to measure burnout⁵. Other models like the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) model and Leiter & Maslach’s Areas of Worklife model identify key areas where imbalances can lead to burnout³.
4. **Prevention and Management**: Many companies offer wellness benefits such as yoga, meditation app subscriptions, well-being days, and trainings on time management and productivity¹. However, interventions targeting only individuals are far less likely to have a sustainable impact on employee health than systemic solutions, including organizational-level interventions¹.
